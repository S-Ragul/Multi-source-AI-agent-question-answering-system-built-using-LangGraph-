        "# **Project Title: Multi-Source Intelligent Question Answering System Using LangGraph**\n",
        "### **Primary Objective:**\n",
        "To develop and implement an intelligent question-answering system that leverages LangGraph to dynamically route user queries to the most appropriate knowledge source (vector database, Wikipedia, or Google Search) for accurate and relevant responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Project Goal:**\n",
        "To create a functional and reliable question-answering system capable of providing accurate and contextually relevant answers to user inquiries by intelligently selecting and querying appropriate information sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Project Procedure:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 1: Environment Setup and Dependency Installation:**\n",
        "Install necessary Python libraries (LangChain, LangGraph, vector database connectors, API wrappers, etc.).\n",
        "Configure API keys and environment variables.\n",
        "Setup the vector database and populate it with relevant data.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Phase 3: LangGraph Workflow Development:**\n",
        "Define the GraphState for managing the application's state.\n",
        "Create nodes for data retrieval from each source (vector database, Wikipedia, Google Search).\n",
        "Implement a routing function (route_question) to direct queries based on LLM analysis.\n",
        "Construct the StateGraph with nodes and conditional edges.\n",
        "Compile the workflow into an executable application.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 4: User Interface and Interaction:**\n",
        "Develop an interactive command-line interface for user input.\n",
        "Implement output formatting to display results and source attribution.\n",
        "Add error handling and user feedback mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 5: Testing and Evaluation:**\n",
        "Test the system with a variety of questions to assess accuracy and performance.\n",
        "Evaluate the routing logic and data source selection.\n",

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples.

Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'title': \"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'title': \"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'title': \"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization.

While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}.

Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'title': \"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.

Check my previous post on controllable text generation.\\n[My personal spicy take] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.\\nBasic Prompting#\\nZero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.\\nZero-Shot#\\nZero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.\\n(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)\\nText: i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nSentiment:\\nFew-shot#\\nFew-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.\\nText: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.\\nSentiment: positive\\n\\nText: despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.\\nSentiment: negative\\n\\nText: for the first time in years, de niro digs deep emotionally, perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars.\\nSentiment: positive\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/', 'title': \"Prompt Engineering | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights.

(2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A.\\nTips for Example Selection#\\n\\n\\nChoose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)\\n\\n\\nTo select a diverse and representative set of examples, Su et al. (2022) proposed to use a graph-based approach: (1) First, construct a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ based on the embedding (e.g. by SBERT or other embedding models) cosine similarity between samples, where each node points to its $k$ nearest neighbors; (2) Start with a set of selected samples $\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\emptyset$ and a set of remaining samples $\\\\mathcal{U}$. Each sample $u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}$ is scored by $$\\n\\\\text{score}(u) = \\\\sum_{v \\\\in \\\\{v \\\\mid (u, v) \\\\in E, v\\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}\\\\}} s(v)\\\\quad\\\\text{where }s(v)=\\\\rho^{- \\\\vert \\\\{\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\vert (v, \\\\ell)\\\\in E \\\\}\\\\vert},\\\\quad\\\\rho > 1\\n$$ such that $s(v)$ is low if many of $v$’s neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages to pick diverse samples.\\n\\n\\nRubin et al. (2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection.  Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\\\\text{score}(e_i) = P_\\\\text{LM}(y \\\\mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.\\n\\n\\nSome researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)\\n\\n\\nMotivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.\\n\\n\\nTips for Example Ordering#\\n\\nA general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.\\nIncreasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions.

Check my previous post on controllable text generation.', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Instruction Prompting#\\nThe purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?\\nInstructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.\\nWhen interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say “not do something” but rather specify what to do.\\nPlease label the sentiment towards the movie of the given movie review.

It incorporates multiple demonstration examples across different tasks in the prompt, each demonstration consisting of instruction, task input and output. Note that their experiments were only on classification tasks and the instruction prompt contains all label options.\\nDefinition: Determine the speaker of the dialogue, \"agent\" or \"customer\".\\nInput: I have successfully booked your tickets.\\nOuput: agent\\n\\nDefinition: Determine which category the question asks for, \"Quantity\" or \"Location\".\\nInput: What\\'s the oldest building in US?\\nOuput: Location\\n\\nDefinition: Classify the sentiment of the given movie review, \"positive\" or \"negative\".\\nInput: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nOutput:\\nSelf-Consistency Sampling#\\nSelf-consistency sampling (Wang et al. 2022a) is to sample multiple outputs with temperature > 0 and then selecting the best one out of these candidates.\\nThe criteria for selecting the best candidate can vary from task to task. A general solution is to pick majority vote. For tasks that are easy to validate such as a programming question with unit tests, we can simply run through the interpreter and verify the correctness with unit tests.\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT)#\\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al. 2022) generates a sequence of short sentences to describe reasoning logics step by step, known as reasoning chains or rationales, to eventually lead to the final answer. The benefit of CoT is more pronounced for complicated reasoning tasks, while using large models (e.g. with more than 50B parameters). Simple tasks only benefit slightly from CoT prompting.\\nTypes of CoT prompts#\\nTwo main types of CoT prompting:\\n\\nFew-shot CoT.

How long will each final cut be?\\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\\nTips and Extensions#\\n\\n\\nSelf-consistency sampling can improve reasoning accuracy by sampling a number of diverse answers and then taking the majority vote. (Wang et al. 2022a)\\n\\n\\nAnother approach for ensemble learning is to alter the example order or use model generated rationales to replace human-written ones to introduce randomness during multiple sample trials. Then aggregate model outputs with a majority vote to get final answer. (Wang et al. 2022b)\\n\\n\\nIf training examples are only associated with true answers (easy to verify!) but no rationales, we can follow the STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner; Zelikman et al. 2022) method : (1) Ask LLM to generate reasoning chains and only keep those leading to correct answers; (2) Then fine-tune the model with generated rationales and repeat the process until convergence. Note that higher temperature is more likely to generate incorrect rationales with correct answers. If training examples do not have ground truth answers, maybe consider using majority votes as the “correct” answers.\\n\\n\\nPrompts with demonstrations of higher reasoning complexity can achieve better performance, where complexity is measured by the number of reasoning steps in the chains. When separating reasoning steps, newline \\\\n symbol works better than step i, period . or semicolon ;. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nComplexity-based consistency is to explicitly prefer complex chains among all the generations by taking majority vote among only top $k$ complex chains. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nLater, Shum et al. (2023) found that in their experiments CoT prompts with only complex examples can improve the accuracy of complex questions, but perform poorly in simple questions; evidence shown on GSM8k.\\n\\n\\nChanging Q: to Question: is found to be helpful. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nYe & Durrett (2022) found that the benefit of including explanations in the prompt is small to moderate for NLP tasks that involve reasoning over text (i.e. QA and NLI) and the effects vary by models. They observed that explanations are more likely to be nonfactual than be inconsistent (i.e. whether explanation entails prediction). Nonfactual explanations most likely lead to incorrect predictions.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/', 'title': \"Prompt Engineering | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights.

This section in my “Controllable Neural Text Generation” post has a good coverage of them. The trend from AutoPrompt to Prompt-Tuning is that the setup gets gradually simplified.\\nAPE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.\\n\\n\\nPrompt LLM to generate instruction candidates based on a small set of demonstrations in the form of input-output pairs.

Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.\\nEvidence: ...\\nQuestion: ...\\nAnswer: ...\\nThe answer probability is computed in three ways:\\n\\nRAG style, $p(a_i \\\\mid q) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid q, p_i)$, where $p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q)$ is the normalized cosine similarities between the TF-IDF passage and question representations.\\nNoisy channel inference, $p(a_i\\\\mid q) = \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid a_i, p_i) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid p_i)}{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i)}$\\nProduct-of-Experts (PoE), combines all probabilities used above in addition to $p_\\\\text{LM}(p_i \\\\mid q)$.\\n\\nAccording to their experiments on generation and classification tasks, among three answer reranking scores - PoE > Noisy channel > RAG. Among individual probabilities, $p_\\\\text{LM}(a \\\\mid q, p_i)$ and $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ are found to be most informative. $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ captures how well the question can be explained by LM given evidence paragraph and answer and can reliably be used for reranking answer candidates.\\nOne observation with SituatedQA dataset for questions grounded in different dates is that despite LM (pretraining cutoff is year 2020) has access to latest information via Google Search, its performance on post-2020 questions are still a lot worse than on pre-2020 questions. This suggests the existence of some discrepencies or conflicting parametric between contextual information and model internal knowledge.\\nInterestingly it is found to be beneficial even with only “internal retrieval”, that is, to generate knowledge about a topic before answering the question (Liu et al. 2022). First we can use  the following template to extract knowledge:\\nGenerate some knowledge about the input. Examples:\\n\\nInput: What type of water formation is formed by clouds?\\nKnowledge: Clouds are made of water vapor.\\n\\nInput: {question}\\nKnowledge:\\nAnd then with model-generated knowledge, prompt the LM further to get the answer.\\nProgramming Language#\\nBoth PAL (Program-aided language models); Gao et al. 2022) and PoT (Program of Thoughts prompting; Chen et al. 2022) ask LLM to generate programming language statements to resolve natural language reasoning problems, hence offloading the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter.

Comparing CoT and PoT. (Image source: Chen et al. 2022).\\nExternal APIs#\\nTALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) is a language model augmented with text-to-text API calls. LM is guided to generate |tool-call and tool input text conditioned on task input text to construct API call requests. When |result shows up, the specified tool API is called and the returned result gets appended to the text sequence. The final output is generated following |output token.\\n\\nFig. 4. The format of API calls in TALM. (Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\nTALM adopts a self-play approach to iteratively bootstrap the dataset of tool use examples and finetune LM with it. This self-play, defined as a model interacting with a tool API, iteratively expands the dataset based on whether a newly added tool API can improve the model outputs. Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a binary reward signal.\\n\\nFig. 5. Self-play iterations help boost the model performance.(Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\nToolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API. The toolbox of Toolformer includes:\\n\\nCalculator to help LM with the lack of precise math skills;\\nQ&A system to help with unfaithful content and hallucination;\\nSearch engine to provide up-to-date information after pretraining cut off time;\\nTranslation system to improve performance on low resource language;\\nCalendar to make LM be aware of time progression.\\n\\n\\nFig. 6.

Much early literature focused on classification tasks, while recent effort starts to investigate more into outputs of generative models. In the context of large language models In this post we assume the attacks only happen at inference time, meaning that model weights are fixed.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT.

An overview of threats to LLM-based applications. (Image source: Greshake et al. 2023)\\nClassification#\\nAdversarial attacks on classifiers have attracted more attention in the research community in the past, many in the image domain. LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{adv}$, with imperceptible difference from $\\\\mathbf{x}$, such that $f(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\neq f(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{adv})$.\\nText Generation#\\nGiven an input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and a generative model $p(.)$, we have the model output a sample $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(.\\\\vert\\\\mathbf{x})$ . An adversarial attack would identify such $p(\\\\mathbf{x})$ that $\\\\mathbf{y}$ would violate the built-in safe behavior of the model $p$; E.g. output unsafe content on illegal topics, leak private information or model training data. For generative tasks, it is not easy to judge the success of an attack, which demands a super high-quality classifier to judge whether $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is unsafe or human review.\\nWhite-box vs Black-box#\\nWhite-box attacks assume that attackers have full access to the model weights, architecture and training pipeline, such that attackers can obtain gradient signals. We don’t assume attackers have access to the full training data. This is only possible for open-sourced models.\\nBlack-box attacks assume that attackers only have access to an API-like service where they provide input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and get back sample $\\\\mathbf{y}$, without knowing further information about the model.\\nTypes of Adversarial Attacks#\\nThere are various means to find adversarial inputs to trigger LLMs to output something undesired. We present five approaches here.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttack\\nType\\nDescription\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToken manipulation\\nBlack-box\\nAlter a small fraction of tokens in the text input such that it triggers model failure but still remain its original semantic meanings.\\n\\n\\nGradient based attack\\nWhite-box\\nRely on gradient signals to learn an effective attack.\\n\\n\\nJailbreak prompting\\nBlack-box\\nOften heuristic based prompting to “jailbreak” built-in model safety.\\n\\n\\nHuman red-teaming\\nBlack-box\\nHuman attacks the model, with or without assist from other models.\\n\\n\\nModel red-teaming\\nBlack-box\\nModel attacks the model, where the attacker model can be fine-tuned.\\n\\n\\n\\nToken Manipulation#\\nGiven a piece of text input containing a sequence of tokens, we can apply simple token operations like replacement with synonyms to trigger the model to make the incorrect predictions. Token manipulation based attacks work in black box settings. The Python framework, TextAttack (Morris et al. 2020), implemented many word and token manipulation attack methods to create adversarial examples for NLP models. Most work in this area experimented with classification and entailment prediction.\\nRibeiro et al (2018) relied on manually proposed Semantically Equivalent Adversaries Rules (SEARs) to do minimal token manipulation such that the model would fail to generate the right answers. Example rules include (What NOUN→Which NOUN), (WP is → WP’s’), (was→is), etc. The semantic equivalence after adversarial operation is checked via back-translation. Those rules are proposed via a pretty manual, heuristic process and the type of model “bugs” SEARs are probing for are only limited on sensitivity to minimal token variation, which should not be an issue with increased base LLM capability.\\nIn comparison, EDA (Easy Data Augmentation; Wei & Zou 2019) defines a set of simple and more general operations to augment text: synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap or random deletion. EDA augmentation is shown to improve the classification accuracy on several benchmarks.\\nTextFooler (Jin et al. 2019) and BERT-Attack (Li et al. 2020) follows the same process of first identifying the most important and vulnerable words that alter the model prediction the most and then replace those words in some way.\\nGiven a classifier $f$ and an input text string $\\\\mathbf{x}$, the importance score of each word can be measured by:'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT.

Words with high importance are good candidates to be replaced, but stop words should be skipped to avoid grammar destruction.\\nTextFooler replaces those words with top synonyms based on word embedding cosine similarity and then further filters by checking that the replacement word still has the same POS tagging and the sentence level similarity is above a threshold. BERT-Attack instead replaces words with semantically similar words via BERT given that context-aware prediction is a very natural use case for masked language models. Adversarial examples discovered this way have some transferability between models, varying by models and tasks.\\nGradient based Attacks#\\nIn the white-box setting, we have full access to the model parameters and architecture. Therefore we can rely on gradient descent to programmatically learn the most effective attacks. Gradient based attacks only work in the white-box setting, like for open source LLMs.\\nGBDA (“Gradient-based Distributional Attack”; Guo et al. 2021) uses Gumbel-Softmax approximation trick to make adversarial loss optimization differentiable, where BERTScore and perplexity are used to enforce perceptibility and fluency. Given an input of tokens $\\\\mathbf{x}=[x_1, x_2 \\\\dots x_n]$ where one token $x_i$ can be sampled from a categorical distribution $P_\\\\Theta$, where  $\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}$ and $V$ is the token vocabulary size. It is highly over-parameterized, considering that  $V$ is usually around $O(10,000)$  and most adversarial examples only need a few token replacements. We have:\\n$$\\nx_i \\\\sim P_{\\\\Theta_i} = \\\\text{Categorical}(\\\\pi_i) = \\\\text{Categorical}(\\\\text{Softmax}(\\\\Theta_i))\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\pi_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^V$ is a vector of token probabilities for the $i$-th token. The adversarial objective function to minimize is to produce incorrect label different from the correct label $y$ for a classifier $f$: $\\\\min_{\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}} \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim P_{\\\\Theta}} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{X}, y; f)$. However, on the surface, this is not differentiable because of the categorical distribution. Using Gumbel-softmax approximation (Jang et al. 2016) we approximate the categorical distribution from the Gumbel distribution $\\\\tilde{P}_\\\\Theta$ by $\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tilde{\\\\pi}_i^{(j)} = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\Theta_{ij} + g_{ij}}{\\\\tau})}{\\\\sum_{v=1}^V \\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\Theta_{iv} + g_{iv}}{\\\\tau})}\\n$$'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT.

Because they are input-agnostic and can transfer between models with different embeddings, tokenization and architecture, UATs probably exploit biases effectively in the training data that gets baked into the global model behavior.\\nOne drawback with UAT (Universal Adversarial Trigger) attacks is that it is easy to detect them because the learned triggers are often nonsensical. Mehrabi et al. (2022) studied two variations of UAT that encourage learned toxic triggers to be imperceptible in the context of multi-turn conversations.

In fact, refusal on disallowed content categories such as criminal advice is one important safety mitigation built into GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023). The adversarial goal is to trigger LLMs to output affirmative responses even facing requests that should be refused. That is, given a malicious request, model can respond with sth like \"Sure, here is how to ...\". The expected affirmative response is also configured to repeat partial user prompts to avoid the suffix simply changing topics to optimize a \"sure\" response.

(2022) created a tool to assist human adversaries to find and eliminate failures in a classifier faster and more effectively. Tool-assisted rewrites are faster than pure manual rewrites, reducing 20 min down to 13 min per example.\\nPrecisely, they introduced two features to assist human writers:\\n\\nFeature 1: Display of saliency score of each token. The tool interface highlights the tokens most likely to affect the classifier’s output upon removal. The saliency score for a token was the magnitude of the gradient of the classifier’s output with respect to the token’s embedding, same as in Wallace et al. (2019)\\nFeature 2: Token substitution and insertion. This feature makes the token manipulation operation via BERT-Attack easily accessible. The token updates then get reviewed by human writers.

UI for humans to do tool-assisted adversarial attack on a classifier. Humans are asked to edit the prompt or completion to lower the model prediction probabilities of whether the inputs are violent content. (Image source: Ziegler et al. 2022)\\nBot-Adversarial Dialogue (BAD; Xu et al. 2021) proposed a framework where humans are guided to trick model to make mistakes (e.g. output unsafe content). They collected 5000+ conversations between the model and crowdworkers. Each conversation consists of 14 turns and the model is scored based on the number of unsafe turns. Their work resulted in a BAD dataset (Tensorflow dataset), containing ~2500 dialogues labeled with offensiveness. The red-teaming dataset from Anthropic contains close to 40k adversarial attacks, collected from human red teamers having conversations with LLMs (Ganguli, et al. 2022). They found RLHF models are harder to be attacked as they scale up. Human expert red-teaming is commonly used for all safety preparedness work for big model releases at OpenAI, such as GPT-4 and DALL-E 3.\\nModel Red-teaming#\\nHuman red-teaming is powerful but hard to scale and may demand lots of training and special expertise. Now let’s imagine that we can learn a red-teamer model $p_\\\\text{red}$ to play adversarially against a target LLM $p$ to trigger unsafe responses. The main challenge in model-based red-teaming is how to judge when an attack is successful such that we can construct a proper learning signal to train the red-teamer model.\\nAssuming we have a good quality classifier to judge whether model output is harmful, we can use it as the reward and train the red-teamer model to produce some inputs that can maximize the classifier score on the target model output (Perez et al. 2022). Let $r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$ be such a red team classifier, which can judge whether output $\\\\mathbf{y}$  is harmful given a test input $\\\\mathbf{x}$. Finding adversarial attack examples follows a simple three-step process:\\n\\nSample test inputs from a red-teamer LLM $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(.)$.\\nUse the target LLM $p(\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$ to generate an output $\\\\mathbf{y}$ for each test case $\\\\mathbf{x}$.\\nIdentify a subset of test cases leading to harmful output according to the classifier $r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$.\\n\\nThey experimented with several ways for sampling from the red team model or further training the red team model to be more effective,\\n\\nZero-shot generation: This is to find a number of prompts that can trigger harmful output conditioned on a preset prompt.\\nStochastic few-shot generation: The red team prompts found from the above step are then used as few-shot examples to generate more similar cases. Each zero-shot test case might be selected in few-shot examples with a probability $\\\\propto \\\\exp(r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) / \\\\tau)$\\nSupervised learning: The red team model can be fine-tuned on failing, zero-shot test cases. The training only runs lightly for one epoch to avoid overfitting and preserve sample diversity.\\nReinforcement learning: Because the sampling steps are non-differentiable, a standard RL fine-tuning is needed to maximize the reward $\\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(.)} [r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})]$, with a KL divergence term between current  $p_\\\\text{red}$ and the initial model behavior, where $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is a sample from the target model, $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(. \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$.

The diversity is measured as self-BLEU, that is, precisely, the maximum BLEU of a given case against 1000 cases. Lower self-BLEU indicates better diversity. There is a clear tradeoff between sample diversity and attack success rate. Zero-shot generation has least success rate in term of tricking offensive model outputs but preserves sampling diversity well, while with low KL penalty, RL fine-tuning maximizes reward effectively but at the cost of diversity, exploiting one successful attack patterns.\\n\\nFig. 14.

(Image source: Perez et al. 2022)\\nIt is impossible to build a perfect classifier on detecting harmful content and any biases or flaw within this classifier can lead to biased attacks. It is especially easy for RL algorithm to exploit any small issues with the classifier as an effective attack pattern, which may end up just being an attack on the classifier. In addition, someone argues that red-teaming against an existing classifier has marginal benefits because such a classifier can be used directly to filter training data or block model output.\\nCasper et al. (2023) set up a human-in-the-loop red teaming process. The main difference from Perez et al. (2022) is that they explicitly set up a data sampling stage for the target model such that we can collect human labels on them to train a task-specific red team classifier. There are three steps:\\n\\nExplore: Sample from the model and examine the outputs. Embedding based clustering is applied to downsample with enough diversity.\\nEstablish: Humans judge the model outputs as good vs bad. Then a harmfulness classifier is trained with human labels.\\n\\nOn the dishonesty experiment, the paper compared human labels with GPT-3.5-turbo labels. Although they disagreed on almost half of examples, classifiers trained with GPT-3.5-turbo or human labels achieved comparable accuracy. Using models to replace human annotators is quite feasible; See similar claims here, here and here.\\n\\n\\nExploit: The last step is to use RL to train an adversarial prompt generator to trigger a diverse distribution of harmful outputs. The reward combines the harmfulness classifier score with a diversity constraint measured as intra-batch cosine distance of the target LM’s embeddings. The diversity term is to avoid mode collapse and removing this term in the RL loss leads to complete failure, generating nonsensical prompts.\\n\\n\\nFig. 15.

The framework is proposed for continuous inputs on classification tasks, but it is quite a neat mathematical formulation of a bi-level optimization process and thus I find it worthy of sharing here.\\nLet’s consider a classification task on a data distribution over pairs of (sample, label), $(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}$ , the objective of training a robust classifier refers to a saddle point problem:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\min_\\\\theta \\\\mathbb{E}_{(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{D}} [\\\\max_{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{S}} \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}, y;\\\\theta)]\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{S} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^d$ refers to a set of allowed perturbation for the adversary; E.g. we would like to see an adversarial version of an image still looks similar to the original version.\\nThe objective is composed of an inner maximization problem and an outer minimization problem:\\n\\nInner maximization: find the most effective adversarial data point, $\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}$, that leads to high loss. All the adversarial attack methods eventually come down to ways to maximize the loss in the inner loop.\\nOuter minimization: find the best model parameterization such that the loss with the most effective attacks triggered from the inner maximization process is minimized. Naive way to train a robust model is to replace each data point with their perturbed versions, which can be multiple adversarial variants of one data point.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT.

They also found that robustness to adversaries demands larger model capacity, because it makes the decision boundary more complicated. Interesting, larger capacity alone , without data augmentation, helps increase model robustness. (Image source: Madry et al. 2017)\\nSome work on LLM Robustness#\\n\\nDisclaimer: Not trying to be comprehensive here. Need a separate blog post to go deeper.)\\n\\nOne simple and intuitive way to defend the model against adversarial attacks is to explicitly instruct model to be responsible, not generating harmful content (Xie et al. 2023). It can largely reduce the success rate of jailbreak attacks, but has side effects for general model quality due to the model acting more conservatively (e.g. for creative writing) or incorrectly interpreting the instruction under some scenarios (e.g. safe-unsafe classification).\\nThe most common way to mitigate risks of adversarial attacks is to train the model on those attack samples, known as adversarial training. It is considered as the strongest defense but leading to tradeoff between robustness and model performance. In an experiment by Jain et al. 2023, they tested two adversarial training setups: (1) run gradient descent on harmful prompts paired with \"I\\'m sorry. As a ...\" response; (2) run one descent step on a refusal response and an ascend step on a red-team bad response per training step. The method (2) ends up being quite useless because the model generation quality degrades a lot, while the drop in attack success rate is tiny.\\nWhite-box attacks often lead to nonsensical adversarial prompts and thus they can be detected by examining perplexity. Of course, a white-box attack can directly bypass this by explicitly optimizing for lower perplexity, such as UAT-LM, a variation of UAT. However, there is a tradeoff and it can lead to lower attack success rate.\\n\\nFig. 18. Perplexity filter can block attacks by [Zou et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043). \"PPL Passed\" and \"PPL Window Passed\" are the rates at which harmful prompts with an adversarial suffix bypass the filter without detection. The lower the pass rate the better the filter is. (Image source: Jain et al. 2023)\\nJain et al. 2023 also tested methods of preprocessing text inputs to remove adversarial modifications while semantic meaning remains.\\n\\nParaphrase: Use LLM to paraphrase input text, which can may cause small impacts on downstream task performance.\\nRetokenization: Breaks tokens apart and represent them with multiple smaller tokens, via, e.g. BPE-dropout (drop random p% tokens). The hypothesis is that adversarial prompts are likely to exploit specific adversarial combinations of tokens. This does help degrade the attack success rate but is limited, e.g. 90+% down to 40%.\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Oct 2023). “Adversarial Attacks on LLMs”.

Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'title': \"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'title': \"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'title': \"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization.

While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\".

The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al.

Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.

An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.\\nBasic Prompting#\\nZero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.\\nZero-Shot#\\nZero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.\\n(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)\\nText: i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nSentiment:\\nFew-shot#\\nFew-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.\\nText: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.\\nSentiment: positive\\n\\nText: despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.\\nSentiment: negative\\n\\nText: for the first time in years, de niro digs deep emotionally, perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars.\\nSentiment: positive\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/', 'title': \"Prompt Engineering | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights.

(2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A.\\nTips for Example Selection#\\n\\n\\nChoose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)\\n\\n\\nTo select a diverse and representative set of examples, Su et al. (2022) proposed to use a graph-based approach: (1) First, construct a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ based on the embedding (e.g. by SBERT or other embedding models) cosine similarity between samples, where each node points to its $k$ nearest neighbors; (2) Start with a set of selected samples $\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\emptyset$ and a set of remaining samples $\\\\mathcal{U}$. Each sample $u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}$ is scored by $$\\n\\\\text{score}(u) = \\\\sum_{v \\\\in \\\\{v \\\\mid (u, v) \\\\in E, v\\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}\\\\}} s(v)\\\\quad\\\\text{where }s(v)=\\\\rho^{- \\\\vert \\\\{\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\vert (v, \\\\ell)\\\\in E \\\\}\\\\vert},\\\\quad\\\\rho > 1\\n$$ such that $s(v)$ is low if many of $v$’s neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages to pick diverse samples.\\n\\n\\nRubin et al. (2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection.  Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\\\\text{score}(e_i) = P_\\\\text{LM}(y \\\\mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.\\n\\n\\nSome researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)\\n\\n\\nMotivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.\\n\\n\\nTips for Example Ordering#\\n\\nA general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.\\nIncreasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions.

However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?\\nInstructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.\\nWhen interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say “not do something” but rather specify what to do.\\nPlease label the sentiment towards the movie of the given movie review.

It incorporates multiple demonstration examples across different tasks in the prompt, each demonstration consisting of instruction, task input and output. Note that their experiments were only on classification tasks and the instruction prompt contains all label options.\\nDefinition: Determine the speaker of the dialogue, \"agent\" or \"customer\".\\nInput: I have successfully booked your tickets.\\nOuput: agent\\n\\nDefinition: Determine which category the question asks for, \"Quantity\" or \"Location\".\\nInput: What\\'s the oldest building in US?\\nOuput: Location\\n\\nDefinition: Classify the sentiment of the given movie review, \"positive\" or \"negative\".\\nInput: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nOutput:\\nSelf-Consistency Sampling#\\nSelf-consistency sampling (Wang et al. 2022a) is to sample multiple outputs with temperature > 0 and then selecting the best one out of these candidates.\\nThe criteria for selecting the best candidate can vary from task to task. A general solution is to pick majority vote. For tasks that are easy to validate such as a programming question with unit tests, we can simply run through the interpreter and verify the correctness with unit tests.\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT)#\\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al. 2022) generates a sequence of short sentences to describe reasoning logics step by step, known as reasoning chains or rationales, to eventually lead to the final answer. The benefit of CoT is more pronounced for complicated reasoning tasks, while using large models (e.g. with more than 50B parameters). Simple tasks only benefit slightly from CoT prompting.\\nTypes of CoT prompts#\\nTwo main types of CoT prompting:\\n\\nFew-shot CoT.

(Wang et al. 2022a)\\n\\n\\nAnother approach for ensemble learning is to alter the example order or use model generated rationales to replace human-written ones to introduce randomness during multiple sample trials. Then aggregate model outputs with a majority vote to get final answer. (Wang et al. 2022b)\\n\\n\\nIf training examples are only associated with true answers (easy to verify!) but no rationales, we can follow the STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner; Zelikman et al. 2022) method : (1) Ask LLM to generate reasoning chains and only keep those leading to correct answers; (2) Then fine-tune the model with generated rationales and repeat the process until convergence. Note that higher temperature is more likely to generate incorrect rationales with correct answers. If training examples do not have ground truth answers, maybe consider using majority votes as the “correct” answers.\\n\\n\\nPrompts with demonstrations of higher reasoning complexity can achieve better performance, where complexity is measured by the number of reasoning steps in the chains. When separating reasoning steps, newline \\\\n symbol works better than step i, period . or semicolon ;. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nComplexity-based consistency is to explicitly prefer complex chains among all the generations by taking majority vote among only top $k$ complex chains. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nLater, Shum et al. (2023) found that in their experiments CoT prompts with only complex examples can improve the accuracy of complex questions, but perform poorly in simple questions; evidence shown on GSM8k.\\n\\n\\nChanging Q: to Question: is found to be helpful. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nYe & Durrett (2022) found that the benefit of including explanations in the prompt is small to moderate for NLP tasks that involve reasoning over text (i.e. QA and NLI) and the effects vary by models. They observed that explanations are more likely to be nonfactual than be inconsistent (i.e. whether explanation entails prediction). Nonfactual explanations most likely lead to incorrect predictions.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/', 'title': \"Prompt Engineering | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights.

This section in my “Controllable Neural Text Generation” post has a good coverage of them. The trend from AutoPrompt to Prompt-Tuning is that the setup gets gradually simplified.\\nAPE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.\\n\\n\\nPrompt LLM to generate instruction candidates based on a small set of demonstrations in the form of input-output pairs.

Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.\\nEvidence: ...\\nQuestion: ...\\nAnswer: ...\\nThe answer probability is computed in three ways:\\n\\nRAG style, $p(a_i \\\\mid q) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid q, p_i)$, where $p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q)$ is the normalized cosine similarities between the TF-IDF passage and question representations.\\nNoisy channel inference, $p(a_i\\\\mid q) = \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid a_i, p_i) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid p_i)}{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i)}$\\nProduct-of-Experts (PoE), combines all probabilities used above in addition to $p_\\\\text{LM}(p_i \\\\mid q)$.\\n\\nAccording to their experiments on generation and classification tasks, among three answer reranking scores - PoE > Noisy channel > RAG. Among individual probabilities, $p_\\\\text{LM}(a \\\\mid q, p_i)$ and $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ are found to be most informative. $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ captures how well the question can be explained by LM given evidence paragraph and answer and can reliably be used for reranking answer candidates.\\nOne observation with SituatedQA dataset for questions grounded in different dates is that despite LM (pretraining cutoff is year 2020) has access to latest information via Google Search, its performance on post-2020 questions are still a lot worse than on pre-2020 questions. This suggests the existence of some discrepencies or conflicting parametric between contextual information and model internal knowledge.\\nInterestingly it is found to be beneficial even with only “internal retrieval”, that is, to generate knowledge about a topic before answering the question (Liu et al. 2022). First we can use  the following template to extract knowledge:\\nGenerate some knowledge about the input. Examples:\\n\\nInput: What type of water formation is formed by clouds?\\nKnowledge: Clouds are made of water vapor.\\n\\nInput: {question}\\nKnowledge:\\nAnd then with model-generated knowledge, prompt the LM further to get the answer.\\nProgramming Language#\\nBoth PAL (Program-aided language models); Gao et al. 2022) and PoT (Program of Thoughts prompting; Chen et al. 2022) ask LLM to generate programming language statements to resolve natural language reasoning problems, hence offloading the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter.

Comparing CoT and PoT. (Image source: Chen et al. 2022).\\nExternal APIs#\\nTALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) is a language model augmented with text-to-text API calls. LM is guided to generate |tool-call and tool input text conditioned on task input text to construct API call requests. When |result shows up, the specified tool API is called and the returned result gets appended to the text sequence. The final output is generated following |output token.\\n\\nFig. 4. The format of API calls in TALM. (Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\nTALM adopts a self-play approach to iteratively bootstrap the dataset of tool use examples and finetune LM with it. This self-play, defined as a model interacting with a tool API, iteratively expands the dataset based on whether a newly added tool API can improve the model outputs. Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a binary reward signal.\\n\\nFig. 5. Self-play iterations help boost the model performance.(Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\nToolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API. The toolbox of Toolformer includes:\\n\\nCalculator to help LM with the lack of precise math skills;\\nQ&A system to help with unfaithful content and hallucination;\\nSearch engine to provide up-to-date information after pretraining cut off time;\\nTranslation system to improve performance on low resource language;\\nCalendar to make LM be aware of time progression.\\n\\n\\nFig. 6.

Much early literature focused on classification tasks, while recent effort starts to investigate more into outputs of generative models. In the context of large language models In this post we assume the attacks only happen at inference time, meaning that model weights are fixed.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT.

An overview of threats to LLM-based applications. (Image source: Greshake et al. 2023)\\nClassification#\\nAdversarial attacks on classifiers have attracted more attention in the research community in the past, many in the image domain. LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{adv}$, with imperceptible difference from $\\\\mathbf{x}$, such that $f(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\neq f(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{adv})$.\\nText Generation#\\nGiven an input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and a generative model $p(.)$, we have the model output a sample $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(.\\\\vert\\\\mathbf{x})$ . An adversarial attack would identify such $p(\\\\mathbf{x})$ that $\\\\mathbf{y}$ would violate the built-in safe behavior of the model $p$; E.g. output unsafe content on illegal topics, leak private information or model training data. For generative tasks, it is not easy to judge the success of an attack, which demands a super high-quality classifier to judge whether $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is unsafe or human review.\\nWhite-box vs Black-box#\\nWhite-box attacks assume that attackers have full access to the model weights, architecture and training pipeline, such that attackers can obtain gradient signals. We don’t assume attackers have access to the full training data. This is only possible for open-sourced models.\\nBlack-box attacks assume that attackers only have access to an API-like service where they provide input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and get back sample $\\\\mathbf{y}$, without knowing further information about the model.\\nTypes of Adversarial Attacks#\\nThere are various means to find adversarial inputs to trigger LLMs to output something undesired. We present five approaches here.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttack\\nType\\nDescription\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToken manipulation\\nBlack-box\\nAlter a small fraction of tokens in the text input such that it triggers model failure but still remain its original semantic meanings.\\n\\n\\nGradient based attack\\nWhite-box\\nRely on gradient signals to learn an effective attack.\\n\\n\\nJailbreak prompting\\nBlack-box\\nOften heuristic based prompting to “jailbreak” built-in model safety.\\n\\n\\nHuman red-teaming\\nBlack-box\\nHuman attacks the model, with or without assist from other models.\\n\\n\\nModel red-teaming\\nBlack-box\\nModel attacks the model, where the attacker model can be fine-tuned.\\n\\n\\n\\nToken Manipulation#\\nGiven a piece of text input containing a sequence of tokens, we can apply simple token operations like replacement with synonyms to trigger the model to make the incorrect predictions. Token manipulation based attacks work in black box settings. The Python framework, TextAttack (Morris et al. 2020), implemented many word and token manipulation attack methods to create adversarial examples for NLP models. Most work in this area experimented with classification and entailment prediction.\\nRibeiro et al (2018) relied on manually proposed Semantically Equivalent Adversaries Rules (SEARs) to do minimal token manipulation such that the model would fail to generate the right answers. Example rules include (What NOUN→Which NOUN), (WP is → WP’s’), (was→is), etc. The semantic equivalence after adversarial operation is checked via back-translation. Those rules are proposed via a pretty manual, heuristic process and the type of model “bugs” SEARs are probing for are only limited on sensitivity to minimal token variation, which should not be an issue with increased base LLM capability.\\nIn comparison, EDA (Easy Data Augmentation; Wei & Zou 2019) defines a set of simple and more general operations to augment text: synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap or random deletion. EDA augmentation is shown to improve the classification accuracy on several benchmarks.\\nTextFooler (Jin et al. 2019) and BERT-Attack (Li et al. 2020) follows the same process of first identifying the most important and vulnerable words that alter the model prediction the most and then replace those words in some way.\\nGiven a classifier $f$ and an input text string $\\\\mathbf{x}$, the importance score of each word can be measured by:'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT.

Words with high importance are good candidates to be replaced, but stop words should be skipped to avoid grammar destruction.\\nTextFooler replaces those words with top synonyms based on word embedding cosine similarity and then further filters by checking that the replacement word still has the same POS tagging and the sentence level similarity is above a threshold. BERT-Attack instead replaces words with semantically similar words via BERT given that context-aware prediction is a very natural use case for masked language models. Adversarial examples discovered this way have some transferability between models, varying by models and tasks.\\nGradient based Attacks#\\nIn the white-box setting, we have full access to the model parameters and architecture. Therefore we can rely on gradient descent to programmatically learn the most effective attacks. Gradient based attacks only work in the white-box setting, like for open source LLMs.\\nGBDA (“Gradient-based Distributional Attack”; Guo et al. 2021) uses Gumbel-Softmax approximation trick to make adversarial loss optimization differentiable, where BERTScore and perplexity are used to enforce perceptibility and fluency. Given an input of tokens $\\\\mathbf{x}=[x_1, x_2 \\\\dots x_n]$ where one token $x_i$ can be sampled from a categorical distribution $P_\\\\Theta$, where  $\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}$ and $V$ is the token vocabulary size. It is highly over-parameterized, considering that  $V$ is usually around $O(10,000)$  and most adversarial examples only need a few token replacements. We have:\\n$$\\nx_i \\\\sim P_{\\\\Theta_i} = \\\\text{Categorical}(\\\\pi_i) = \\\\text{Categorical}(\\\\text{Softmax}(\\\\Theta_i))\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\pi_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^V$ is a vector of token probabilities for the $i$-th token. The adversarial objective function to minimize is to produce incorrect label different from the correct label $y$ for a classifier $f$: $\\\\min_{\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}} \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim P_{\\\\Theta}} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{X}, y; f)$. However, on the surface, this is not differentiable because of the categorical distribution. Using Gumbel-softmax approximation (Jang et al. 2016) we approximate the categorical distribution from the Gumbel distribution $\\\\tilde{P}_\\\\Theta$ by $\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tilde{\\\\pi}_i^{(j)} = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\Theta_{ij} + g_{ij}}{\\\\tau})}{\\\\sum_{v=1}^V \\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\Theta_{iv} + g_{iv}}{\\\\tau})}\\n$$'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT.

Because they are input-agnostic and can transfer between models with different embeddings, tokenization and architecture, UATs probably exploit biases effectively in the training data that gets baked into the global model behavior.\\nOne drawback with UAT (Universal Adversarial Trigger) attacks is that it is easy to detect them because the learned triggers are often nonsensical. Mehrabi et al. (2022) studied two variations of UAT that encourage learned toxic triggers to be imperceptible in the context of multi-turn conversations.

In fact, refusal on disallowed content categories such as criminal advice is one important safety mitigation built into GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023). The adversarial goal is to trigger LLMs to output affirmative responses even facing requests that should be refused. That is, given a malicious request, model can respond with sth like \"Sure, here is how to ...\". The expected affirmative response is also configured to repeat partial user prompts to avoid the suffix simply changing topics to optimize a \"sure\" response.

(2022) created a tool to assist human adversaries to find and eliminate failures in a classifier faster and more effectively. Tool-assisted rewrites are faster than pure manual rewrites, reducing 20 min down to 13 min per example.\\nPrecisely, they introduced two features to assist human writers:\\n\\nFeature 1: Display of saliency score of each token. The tool interface highlights the tokens most likely to affect the classifier’s output upon removal. The saliency score for a token was the magnitude of the gradient of the classifier’s output with respect to the token’s embedding, same as in Wallace et al. (2019)\\nFeature 2: Token substitution and insertion. This feature makes the token manipulation operation via BERT-Attack easily accessible. The token updates then get reviewed by human writers.

UI for humans to do tool-assisted adversarial attack on a classifier. Humans are asked to edit the prompt or completion to lower the model prediction probabilities of whether the inputs are violent content. (Image source: Ziegler et al. 2022)\\nBot-Adversarial Dialogue (BAD; Xu et al. 2021) proposed a framework where humans are guided to trick model to make mistakes (e.g. output unsafe content). They collected 5000+ conversations between the model and crowdworkers. Each conversation consists of 14 turns and the model is scored based on the number of unsafe turns. Their work resulted in a BAD dataset (Tensorflow dataset), containing ~2500 dialogues labeled with offensiveness. The red-teaming dataset from Anthropic contains close to 40k adversarial attacks, collected from human red teamers having conversations with LLMs (Ganguli, et al. 2022). They found RLHF models are harder to be attacked as they scale up. Human expert red-teaming is commonly used for all safety preparedness work for big model releases at OpenAI, such as GPT-4 and DALL-E 3.\\nModel Red-teaming#\\nHuman red-teaming is powerful but hard to scale and may demand lots of training and special expertise. Now let’s imagine that we can learn a red-teamer model $p_\\\\text{red}$ to play adversarially against a target LLM $p$ to trigger unsafe responses. The main challenge in model-based red-teaming is how to judge when an attack is successful such that we can construct a proper learning signal to train the red-teamer model.\\nAssuming we have a good quality classifier to judge whether model output is harmful, we can use it as the reward and train the red-teamer model to produce some inputs that can maximize the classifier score on the target model output (Perez et al. 2022). Let $r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$ be such a red team classifier, which can judge whether output $\\\\mathbf{y}$  is harmful given a test input $\\\\mathbf{x}$. Finding adversarial attack examples follows a simple three-step process:\\n\\nSample test inputs from a red-teamer LLM $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(.)$.\\nUse the target LLM $p(\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$ to generate an output $\\\\mathbf{y}$ for each test case $\\\\mathbf{x}$.\\nIdentify a subset of test cases leading to harmful output according to the classifier $r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$.\\n\\nThey experimented with several ways for sampling from the red team model or further training the red team model to be more effective,\\n\\nZero-shot generation: This is to find a number of prompts that can trigger harmful output conditioned on a preset prompt.\\nStochastic few-shot generation: The red team prompts found from the above step are then used as few-shot examples to generate more similar cases. Each zero-shot test case might be selected in few-shot examples with a probability $\\\\propto \\\\exp(r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) / \\\\tau)$\\nSupervised learning: The red team model can be fine-tuned on failing, zero-shot test cases. The training only runs lightly for one epoch to avoid overfitting and preserve sample diversity.\\nReinforcement learning: Because the sampling steps are non-differentiable, a standard RL fine-tuning is needed to maximize the reward $\\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(.)} [r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})]$, with a KL divergence term between current  $p_\\\\text{red}$ and the initial model behavior, where $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is a sample from the target model, $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(. \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$.

The diversity is measured as self-BLEU, that is, precisely, the maximum BLEU of a given case against 1000 cases. Lower self-BLEU indicates better diversity. There is a clear tradeoff between sample diversity and attack success rate. Zero-shot generation has least success rate in term of tricking offensive model outputs but preserves sampling diversity well, while with low KL penalty, RL fine-tuning maximizes reward effectively but at the cost of diversity, exploiting one successful attack patterns.\\n\\nFig. 14.

(Image source: Perez et al. 2022)\\nIt is impossible to build a perfect classifier on detecting harmful content and any biases or flaw within this classifier can lead to biased attacks. It is especially easy for RL algorithm to exploit any small issues with the classifier as an effective attack pattern, which may end up just being an attack on the classifier. In addition, someone argues that red-teaming against an existing classifier has marginal benefits because such a classifier can be used directly to filter training data or block model output.\\nCasper et al. (2023) set up a human-in-the-loop red teaming process. The main difference from Perez et al. (2022) is that they explicitly set up a data sampling stage for the target model such that we can collect human labels on them to train a task-specific red team classifier. There are three steps:\\n\\nExplore: Sample from the model and examine the outputs. Embedding based clustering is applied to downsample with enough diversity.\\nEstablish: Humans judge the model outputs as good vs bad. Then a harmfulness classifier is trained with human labels.\\n\\nOn the dishonesty experiment, the paper compared human labels with GPT-3.5-turbo labels. Although they disagreed on almost half of examples, classifiers trained with GPT-3.5-turbo or human labels achieved comparable accuracy. Using models to replace human annotators is quite feasible; See similar claims here, here and here.\\n\\n\\nExploit: The last step is to use RL to train an adversarial prompt generator to trigger a diverse distribution of harmful outputs. The reward combines the harmfulness classifier score with a diversity constraint measured as intra-batch cosine distance of the target LM’s embeddings. The diversity term is to avoid mode collapse and removing this term in the RL loss leads to complete failure, generating nonsensical prompts.\\n\\n\\nFig. 15.

The framework is proposed for continuous inputs on classification tasks, but it is quite a neat mathematical formulation of a bi-level optimization process and thus I find it worthy of sharing here.\\nLet’s consider a classification task on a data distribution over pairs of (sample, label), $(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}$ , the objective of training a robust classifier refers to a saddle point problem:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\min_\\\\theta \\\\mathbb{E}_{(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{D}} [\\\\max_{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{S}} \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}, y;\\\\theta)]\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{S} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^d$ refers to a set of allowed perturbation for the adversary; E.g. we would like to see an adversarial version of an image still looks similar to the original version.\\nThe objective is composed of an inner maximization problem and an outer minimization problem:\\n\\nInner maximization: find the most effective adversarial data point, $\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}$, that leads to high loss. All the adversarial attack methods eventually come down to ways to maximize the loss in the inner loop.\\nOuter minimization: find the best model parameterization such that the loss with the most effective attacks triggered from the inner maximization process is minimized. Naive way to train a robust model is to replace each data point with their perturbed versions, which can be multiple adversarial variants of one data point.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT.

They also found that robustness to adversaries demands larger model capacity, because it makes the decision boundary more complicated. Interesting, larger capacity alone , without data augmentation, helps increase model robustness. (Image source: Madry et al. 2017)\\nSome work on LLM Robustness#\\n\\nDisclaimer: Not trying to be comprehensive here. Need a separate blog post to go deeper.)\\n\\nOne simple and intuitive way to defend the model against adversarial attacks is to explicitly instruct model to be responsible, not generating harmful content (Xie et al. 2023). It can largely reduce the success rate of jailbreak attacks, but has side effects for general model quality due to the model acting more conservatively (e.g. for creative writing) or incorrectly interpreting the instruction under some scenarios (e.g. safe-unsafe classification).\\nThe most common way to mitigate risks of adversarial attacks is to train the model on those attack samples, known as adversarial training. It is considered as the strongest defense but leading to tradeoff between robustness and model performance. In an experiment by Jain et al. 2023, they tested two adversarial training setups: (1) run gradient descent on harmful prompts paired with \"I\\'m sorry. As a ...\" response; (2) run one descent step on a refusal response and an ascend step on a red-team bad response per training step. The method (2) ends up being quite useless because the model generation quality degrades a lot, while the drop in attack success rate is tiny.\\nWhite-box attacks often lead to nonsensical adversarial prompts and thus they can be detected by examining perplexity. Of course, a white-box attack can directly bypass this by explicitly optimizing for lower perplexity, such as UAT-LM, a variation of UAT. However, there is a tradeoff and it can lead to lower attack success rate.\\n\\nFig. 18. Perplexity filter can block attacks by [Zou et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043). \"PPL Passed\" and \"PPL Window Passed\" are the rates at which harmful prompts with an adversarial suffix bypass the filter without detection. The lower the pass rate the better the filter is. (Image source: Jain et al. 2023)\\nJain et al. 2023 also tested methods of preprocessing text inputs to remove adversarial modifications while semantic meaning remains.\\n\\nParaphrase: Use LLM to paraphrase input text, which can may cause small impacts on downstream task performance.\\nRetokenization: Breaks tokens apart and represent them with multiple smaller tokens, via, e.g. BPE-dropout (drop random p% tokens). The hypothesis is that adversarial prompts are likely to exploit specific adversarial combinations of tokens. This does help degrade the attack success rate but is limited, e.g. 90+% down to 40%.\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Oct 2023). “Adversarial Attacks on LLMs”.

Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'title': \"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'title': \"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'title': \"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization.

While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\".

The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al.

Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.

An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.\\nBasic Prompting#\\nZero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.\\nZero-Shot#\\nZero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.\\n(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)\\nText: i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nSentiment:\\nFew-shot#\\nFew-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.\\nText: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.\\nSentiment: positive\\n\\nText: despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.\\nSentiment: negative\\n\\nText: for the first time in years, de niro digs deep emotionally, perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars.\\nSentiment: positive\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/', 'title': \"Prompt Engineering | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights.

(2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A.\\nTips for Example Selection#\\n\\n\\nChoose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)\\n\\n\\nTo select a diverse and representative set of examples, Su et al. (2022) proposed to use a graph-based approach: (1) First, construct a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ based on the embedding (e.g. by SBERT or other embedding models) cosine similarity between samples, where each node points to its $k$ nearest neighbors; (2) Start with a set of selected samples $\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\emptyset$ and a set of remaining samples $\\\\mathcal{U}$. Each sample $u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}$ is scored by $$\\n\\\\text{score}(u) = \\\\sum_{v \\\\in \\\\{v \\\\mid (u, v) \\\\in E, v\\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}\\\\}} s(v)\\\\quad\\\\text{where }s(v)=\\\\rho^{- \\\\vert \\\\{\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\vert (v, \\\\ell)\\\\in E \\\\}\\\\vert},\\\\quad\\\\rho > 1\\n$$ such that $s(v)$ is low if many of $v$’s neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages to pick diverse samples.\\n\\n\\nRubin et al. (2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection.  Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\\\\text{score}(e_i) = P_\\\\text{LM}(y \\\\mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.\\n\\n\\nSome researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)\\n\\n\\nMotivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.\\n\\n\\nTips for Example Ordering#\\n\\nA general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.\\nIncreasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions.

However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?\\nInstructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.\\nWhen interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say “not do something” but rather specify what to do.\\nPlease label the sentiment towards the movie of the given movie review.

It incorporates multiple demonstration examples across different tasks in the prompt, each demonstration consisting of instruction, task input and output. Note that their experiments were only on classification tasks and the instruction prompt contains all label options.\\nDefinition: Determine the speaker of the dialogue, \"agent\" or \"customer\".\\nInput: I have successfully booked your tickets.\\nOuput: agent\\n\\nDefinition: Determine which category the question asks for, \"Quantity\" or \"Location\".\\nInput: What\\'s the oldest building in US?\\nOuput: Location\\n\\nDefinition: Classify the sentiment of the given movie review, \"positive\" or \"negative\".\\nInput: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nOutput:\\nSelf-Consistency Sampling#\\nSelf-consistency sampling (Wang et al. 2022a) is to sample multiple outputs with temperature > 0 and then selecting the best one out of these candidates.\\nThe criteria for selecting the best candidate can vary from task to task. A general solution is to pick majority vote. For tasks that are easy to validate such as a programming question with unit tests, we can simply run through the interpreter and verify the correctness with unit tests.\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT)#\\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al. 2022) generates a sequence of short sentences to describe reasoning logics step by step, known as reasoning chains or rationales, to eventually lead to the final answer. The benefit of CoT is more pronounced for complicated reasoning tasks, while using large models (e.g. with more than 50B parameters). Simple tasks only benefit slightly from CoT prompting.\\nTypes of CoT prompts#\\nTwo main types of CoT prompting:\\n\\nFew-shot CoT.

(Wang et al. 2022a)\\n\\n\\nAnother approach for ensemble learning is to alter the example order or use model generated rationales to replace human-written ones to introduce randomness during multiple sample trials. Then aggregate model outputs with a majority vote to get final answer. (Wang et al. 2022b)\\n\\n\\nIf training examples are only associated with true answers (easy to verify!) but no rationales, we can follow the STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner; Zelikman et al. 2022) method : (1) Ask LLM to generate reasoning chains and only keep those leading to correct answers; (2) Then fine-tune the model with generated rationales and repeat the process until convergence. Note that higher temperature is more likely to generate incorrect rationales with correct answers. If training examples do not have ground truth answers, maybe consider using majority votes as the “correct” answers.\\n\\n\\nPrompts with demonstrations of higher reasoning complexity can achieve better performance, where complexity is measured by the number of reasoning steps in the chains. When separating reasoning steps, newline \\\\n symbol works better than step i, period . or semicolon ;. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nComplexity-based consistency is to explicitly prefer complex chains among all the generations by taking majority vote among only top $k$ complex chains. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nLater, Shum et al. (2023) found that in their experiments CoT prompts with only complex examples can improve the accuracy of complex questions, but perform poorly in simple questions; evidence shown on GSM8k.\\n\\n\\nChanging Q: to Question: is found to be helpful. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nYe & Durrett (2022) found that the benefit of including explanations in the prompt is small to moderate for NLP tasks that involve reasoning over text (i.e. QA and NLI) and the effects vary by models. They observed that explanations are more likely to be nonfactual than be inconsistent (i.e. whether explanation entails prediction). Nonfactual explanations most likely lead to incorrect predictions.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/', 'title': \"Prompt Engineering | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights.

This section in my “Controllable Neural Text Generation” post has a good coverage of them. The trend from AutoPrompt to Prompt-Tuning is that the setup gets gradually simplified.\\nAPE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.\\n\\n\\nPrompt LLM to generate instruction candidates based on a small set of demonstrations in the form of input-output pairs.

Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.\\nEvidence: ...\\nQuestion: ...\\nAnswer: ...\\nThe answer probability is computed in three ways:\\n\\nRAG style, $p(a_i \\\\mid q) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid q, p_i)$, where $p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q)$ is the normalized cosine similarities between the TF-IDF passage and question representations.\\nNoisy channel inference, $p(a_i\\\\mid q) = \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid a_i, p_i) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid p_i)}{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i)}$\\nProduct-of-Experts (PoE), combines all probabilities used above in addition to $p_\\\\text{LM}(p_i \\\\mid q)$.\\n\\nAccording to their experiments on generation and classification tasks, among three answer reranking scores - PoE > Noisy channel > RAG. Among individual probabilities, $p_\\\\text{LM}(a \\\\mid q, p_i)$ and $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ are found to be most informative. $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ captures how well the question can be explained by LM given evidence paragraph and answer and can reliably be used for reranking answer candidates.\\nOne observation with SituatedQA dataset for questions grounded in different dates is that despite LM (pretraining cutoff is year 2020) has access to latest information via Google Search, its performance on post-2020 questions are still a lot worse than on pre-2020 questions. This suggests the existence of some discrepencies or conflicting parametric between contextual information and model internal knowledge.\\nInterestingly it is found to be beneficial even with only “internal retrieval”, that is, to generate knowledge about a topic before answering the question (Liu et al. 2022). First we can use  the following template to extract knowledge:\\nGenerate some knowledge about the input. Examples:\\n\\nInput: What type of water formation is formed by clouds?\\nKnowledge: Clouds are made of water vapor.\\n\\nInput: {question}\\nKnowledge:\\nAnd then with model-generated knowledge, prompt the LM further to get the answer.\\nProgramming Language#\\nBoth PAL (Program-aided language models); Gao et al. 2022) and PoT (Program of Thoughts prompting; Chen et al. 2022) ask LLM to generate programming language statements to resolve natural language reasoning problems, hence offloading the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter.

Comparing CoT and PoT. (Image source: Chen et al. 2022).\\nExternal APIs#\\nTALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) is a language model augmented with text-to-text API calls. LM is guided to generate |tool-call and tool input text conditioned on task input text to construct API call requests. When |result shows up, the specified tool API is called and the returned result gets appended to the text sequence. The final output is generated following |output token.\\n\\nFig. 4. The format of API calls in TALM. (Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\nTALM adopts a self-play approach to iteratively bootstrap the dataset of tool use examples and finetune LM with it. This self-play, defined as a model interacting with a tool API, iteratively expands the dataset based on whether a newly added tool API can improve the model outputs. Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a binary reward signal.\\n\\nFig. 5. Self-play iterations help boost the model performance.(Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\nToolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API. The toolbox of Toolformer includes:\\n\\nCalculator to help LM with the lack of precise math skills;\\nQ&A system to help with unfaithful content and hallucination;\\nSearch engine to provide up-to-date information after pretraining cut off time;\\nTranslation system to improve performance on low resource language;\\nCalendar to make LM be aware of time progression.\\n\\n\\nFig. 6.

Much early literature focused on classification tasks, while recent effort starts to investigate more into outputs of generative models. In the context of large language models In this post we assume the attacks only happen at inference time, meaning that model weights are fixed.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT.

An overview of threats to LLM-based applications. (Image source: Greshake et al. 2023)\\nClassification#\\nAdversarial attacks on classifiers have attracted more attention in the research community in the past, many in the image domain. LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{adv}$, with imperceptible difference from $\\\\mathbf{x}$, such that $f(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\neq f(\\\\mathbf{x}_\\\\text{adv})$.\\nText Generation#\\nGiven an input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and a generative model $p(.)$, we have the model output a sample $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(.\\\\vert\\\\mathbf{x})$ . An adversarial attack would identify such $p(\\\\mathbf{x})$ that $\\\\mathbf{y}$ would violate the built-in safe behavior of the model $p$; E.g. output unsafe content on illegal topics, leak private information or model training data. For generative tasks, it is not easy to judge the success of an attack, which demands a super high-quality classifier to judge whether $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is unsafe or human review.\\nWhite-box vs Black-box#\\nWhite-box attacks assume that attackers have full access to the model weights, architecture and training pipeline, such that attackers can obtain gradient signals. We don’t assume attackers have access to the full training data. This is only possible for open-sourced models.\\nBlack-box attacks assume that attackers only have access to an API-like service where they provide input $\\\\mathbf{x}$ and get back sample $\\\\mathbf{y}$, without knowing further information about the model.\\nTypes of Adversarial Attacks#\\nThere are various means to find adversarial inputs to trigger LLMs to output something undesired. We present five approaches here.\\n\\n\\n\\nAttack\\nType\\nDescription\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToken manipulation\\nBlack-box\\nAlter a small fraction of tokens in the text input such that it triggers model failure but still remain its original semantic meanings.\\n\\n\\nGradient based attack\\nWhite-box\\nRely on gradient signals to learn an effective attack.\\n\\n\\nJailbreak prompting\\nBlack-box\\nOften heuristic based prompting to “jailbreak” built-in model safety.\\n\\n\\nHuman red-teaming\\nBlack-box\\nHuman attacks the model, with or without assist from other models.\\n\\n\\nModel red-teaming\\nBlack-box\\nModel attacks the model, where the attacker model can be fine-tuned.\\n\\n\\n\\nToken Manipulation#\\nGiven a piece of text input containing a sequence of tokens, we can apply simple token operations like replacement with synonyms to trigger the model to make the incorrect predictions. Token manipulation based attacks work in black box settings. The Python framework, TextAttack (Morris et al. 2020), implemented many word and token manipulation attack methods to create adversarial examples for NLP models. Most work in this area experimented with classification and entailment prediction.\\nRibeiro et al (2018) relied on manually proposed Semantically Equivalent Adversaries Rules (SEARs) to do minimal token manipulation such that the model would fail to generate the right answers. Example rules include (What NOUN→Which NOUN), (WP is → WP’s’), (was→is), etc. The semantic equivalence after adversarial operation is checked via back-translation. Those rules are proposed via a pretty manual, heuristic process and the type of model “bugs” SEARs are probing for are only limited on sensitivity to minimal token variation, which should not be an issue with increased base LLM capability.\\nIn comparison, EDA (Easy Data Augmentation; Wei & Zou 2019) defines a set of simple and more general operations to augment text: synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap or random deletion. EDA augmentation is shown to improve the classification accuracy on several benchmarks.\\nTextFooler (Jin et al. 2019) and BERT-Attack (Li et al. 2020) follows the same process of first identifying the most important and vulnerable words that alter the model prediction the most and then replace those words in some way.\\nGiven a classifier $f$ and an input text string $\\\\mathbf{x}$, the importance score of each word can be measured by:'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT.

Words with high importance are good candidates to be replaced, but stop words should be skipped to avoid grammar destruction.\\nTextFooler replaces those words with top synonyms based on word embedding cosine similarity and then further filters by checking that the replacement word still has the same POS tagging and the sentence level similarity is above a threshold. BERT-Attack instead replaces words with semantically similar words via BERT given that context-aware prediction is a very natural use case for masked language models. Adversarial examples discovered this way have some transferability between models, varying by models and tasks.\\nGradient based Attacks#\\nIn the white-box setting, we have full access to the model parameters and architecture. Therefore we can rely on gradient descent to programmatically learn the most effective attacks. Gradient based attacks only work in the white-box setting, like for open source LLMs.\\nGBDA (“Gradient-based Distributional Attack”; Guo et al. 2021) uses Gumbel-Softmax approximation trick to make adversarial loss optimization differentiable, where BERTScore and perplexity are used to enforce perceptibility and fluency. Given an input of tokens $\\\\mathbf{x}=[x_1, x_2 \\\\dots x_n]$ where one token $x_i$ can be sampled from a categorical distribution $P_\\\\Theta$, where  $\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}$ and $V$ is the token vocabulary size. It is highly over-parameterized, considering that  $V$ is usually around $O(10,000)$  and most adversarial examples only need a few token replacements. We have:\\n$$\\nx_i \\\\sim P_{\\\\Theta_i} = \\\\text{Categorical}(\\\\pi_i) = \\\\text{Categorical}(\\\\text{Softmax}(\\\\Theta_i))\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\pi_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^V$ is a vector of token probabilities for the $i$-th token. The adversarial objective function to minimize is to produce incorrect label different from the correct label $y$ for a classifier $f$: $\\\\min_{\\\\Theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times V}} \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim P_{\\\\Theta}} \\\\mathcal{L}_\\\\text{adv}(\\\\mathbf{X}, y; f)$. However, on the surface, this is not differentiable because of the categorical distribution. Using Gumbel-softmax approximation (Jang et al. 2016) we approximate the categorical distribution from the Gumbel distribution $\\\\tilde{P}_\\\\Theta$ by $\\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}}$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tilde{\\\\pi}_i^{(j)} = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\Theta_{ij} + g_{ij}}{\\\\tau})}{\\\\sum_{v=1}^V \\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\Theta_{iv} + g_{iv}}{\\\\tau})}\\n$$'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT.

Because they are input-agnostic and can transfer between models with different embeddings, tokenization and architecture, UATs probably exploit biases effectively in the training data that gets baked into the global model behavior.\\nOne drawback with UAT (Universal Adversarial Trigger) attacks is that it is easy to detect them because the learned triggers are often nonsensical. Mehrabi et al. (2022) studied two variations of UAT that encourage learned toxic triggers to be imperceptible in the context of multi-turn conversations.

In fact, refusal on disallowed content categories such as criminal advice is one important safety mitigation built into GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023). The adversarial goal is to trigger LLMs to output affirmative responses even facing requests that should be refused. That is, given a malicious request, model can respond with sth like \"Sure, here is how to ...\". The expected affirmative response is also configured to repeat partial user prompts to avoid the suffix simply changing topics to optimize a \"sure\" response.

(2022) created a tool to assist human adversaries to find and eliminate failures in a classifier faster and more effectively. Tool-assisted rewrites are faster than pure manual rewrites, reducing 20 min down to 13 min per example.\\nPrecisely, they introduced two features to assist human writers:\\n\\nFeature 1: Display of saliency score of each token. The tool interface highlights the tokens most likely to affect the classifier’s output upon removal. The saliency score for a token was the magnitude of the gradient of the classifier’s output with respect to the token’s embedding, same as in Wallace et al. (2019)\\nFeature 2: Token substitution and insertion. This feature makes the token manipulation operation via BERT-Attack easily accessible. The token updates then get reviewed by human writers.

UI for humans to do tool-assisted adversarial attack on a classifier. Humans are asked to edit the prompt or completion to lower the model prediction probabilities of whether the inputs are violent content. (Image source: Ziegler et al. 2022)\\nBot-Adversarial Dialogue (BAD; Xu et al. 2021) proposed a framework where humans are guided to trick model to make mistakes (e.g. output unsafe content). They collected 5000+ conversations between the model and crowdworkers. Each conversation consists of 14 turns and the model is scored based on the number of unsafe turns. Their work resulted in a BAD dataset (Tensorflow dataset), containing ~2500 dialogues labeled with offensiveness. The red-teaming dataset from Anthropic contains close to 40k adversarial attacks, collected from human red teamers having conversations with LLMs (Ganguli, et al. 2022). They found RLHF models are harder to be attacked as they scale up. Human expert red-teaming is commonly used for all safety preparedness work for big model releases at OpenAI, such as GPT-4 and DALL-E 3.\\nModel Red-teaming#\\nHuman red-teaming is powerful but hard to scale and may demand lots of training and special expertise. Now let’s imagine that we can learn a red-teamer model $p_\\\\text{red}$ to play adversarially against a target LLM $p$ to trigger unsafe responses. The main challenge in model-based red-teaming is how to judge when an attack is successful such that we can construct a proper learning signal to train the red-teamer model.\\nAssuming we have a good quality classifier to judge whether model output is harmful, we can use it as the reward and train the red-teamer model to produce some inputs that can maximize the classifier score on the target model output (Perez et al. 2022). Let $r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$ be such a red team classifier, which can judge whether output $\\\\mathbf{y}$  is harmful given a test input $\\\\mathbf{x}$. Finding adversarial attack examples follows a simple three-step process:\\n\\nSample test inputs from a red-teamer LLM $\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(.)$.\\nUse the target LLM $p(\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$ to generate an output $\\\\mathbf{y}$ for each test case $\\\\mathbf{x}$.\\nIdentify a subset of test cases leading to harmful output according to the classifier $r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})$.\\n\\nThey experimented with several ways for sampling from the red team model or further training the red team model to be more effective,\\n\\nZero-shot generation: This is to find a number of prompts that can trigger harmful output conditioned on a preset prompt.\\nStochastic few-shot generation: The red team prompts found from the above step are then used as few-shot examples to generate more similar cases. Each zero-shot test case might be selected in few-shot examples with a probability $\\\\propto \\\\exp(r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) / \\\\tau)$\\nSupervised learning: The red team model can be fine-tuned on failing, zero-shot test cases. The training only runs lightly for one epoch to avoid overfitting and preserve sample diversity.\\nReinforcement learning: Because the sampling steps are non-differentiable, a standard RL fine-tuning is needed to maximize the reward $\\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\sim p_\\\\text{red}(.)} [r(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y})]$, with a KL divergence term between current  $p_\\\\text{red}$ and the initial model behavior, where $\\\\mathbf{y}$ is a sample from the target model, $\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim p(. \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x})$.

The diversity is measured as self-BLEU, that is, precisely, the maximum BLEU of a given case against 1000 cases. Lower self-BLEU indicates better diversity. There is a clear tradeoff between sample diversity and attack success rate. Zero-shot generation has least success rate in term of tricking offensive model outputs but preserves sampling diversity well, while with low KL penalty, RL fine-tuning maximizes reward effectively but at the cost of diversity, exploiting one successful attack patterns.\\n\\nFig. 14.

(Image source: Perez et al. 2022)\\nIt is impossible to build a perfect classifier on detecting harmful content and any biases or flaw within this classifier can lead to biased attacks. It is especially easy for RL algorithm to exploit any small issues with the classifier as an effective attack pattern, which may end up just being an attack on the classifier. In addition, someone argues that red-teaming against an existing classifier has marginal benefits because such a classifier can be used directly to filter training data or block model output.\\nCasper et al. (2023) set up a human-in-the-loop red teaming process. The main difference from Perez et al. (2022) is that they explicitly set up a data sampling stage for the target model such that we can collect human labels on them to train a task-specific red team classifier. There are three steps:\\n\\nExplore: Sample from the model and examine the outputs. Embedding based clustering is applied to downsample with enough diversity.\\nEstablish: Humans judge the model outputs as good vs bad. Then a harmfulness classifier is trained with human labels.\\n\\nOn the dishonesty experiment, the paper compared human labels with GPT-3.5-turbo labels. Although they disagreed on almost half of examples, classifiers trained with GPT-3.5-turbo or human labels achieved comparable accuracy. Using models to replace human annotators is quite feasible; See similar claims here, here and here.\\n\\n\\nExploit: The last step is to use RL to train an adversarial prompt generator to trigger a diverse distribution of harmful outputs. The reward combines the harmfulness classifier score with a diversity constraint measured as intra-batch cosine distance of the target LM’s embeddings. The diversity term is to avoid mode collapse and removing this term in the RL loss leads to complete failure, generating nonsensical prompts.\\n\\n\\nFig. 15.

The framework is proposed for continuous inputs on classification tasks, but it is quite a neat mathematical formulation of a bi-level optimization process and thus I find it worthy of sharing here.\\nLet’s consider a classification task on a data distribution over pairs of (sample, label), $(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}$ , the objective of training a robust classifier refers to a saddle point problem:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\min_\\\\theta \\\\mathbb{E}_{(\\\\mathbf{x}, y) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{D}} [\\\\max_{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{S}} \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}, y;\\\\theta)]\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{S} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^d$ refers to a set of allowed perturbation for the adversary; E.g. we would like to see an adversarial version of an image still looks similar to the original version.\\nThe objective is composed of an inner maximization problem and an outer minimization problem:\\n\\nInner maximization: find the most effective adversarial data point, $\\\\mathbf{x} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\delta}$, that leads to high loss. All the adversarial attack methods eventually come down to ways to maximize the loss in the inner loop.\\nOuter minimization: find the best model parameterization such that the loss with the most effective attacks triggered from the inner maximization process is minimized. Naive way to train a robust model is to replace each data point with their perturbed versions, which can be multiple adversarial variants of one data point.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\", 'description': 'The use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT.

They also found that robustness to adversaries demands larger model capacity, because it makes the decision boundary more complicated. Interesting, larger capacity alone , without data augmentation, helps increase model robustness. (Image source: Madry et al. 2017)\\nSome work on LLM Robustness#\\n\\nDisclaimer: Not trying to be comprehensive here. Need a separate blog post to go deeper.)\\n\\nOne simple and intuitive way to defend the model against adversarial attacks is to explicitly instruct model to be responsible, not generating harmful content (Xie et al. 2023). It can largely reduce the success rate of jailbreak attacks, but has side effects for general model quality due to the model acting more conservatively (e.g. for creative writing) or incorrectly interpreting the instruction under some scenarios (e.g. safe-unsafe classification).\\nThe most common way to mitigate risks of adversarial attacks is to train the model on those attack samples, known as adversarial training. It is considered as the strongest defense but leading to tradeoff between robustness and model performance. In an experiment by Jain et al. 2023, they tested two adversarial training setups: (1) run gradient descent on harmful prompts paired with \"I\\'m sorry. As a ...\" response; (2) run one descent step on a refusal response and an ascend step on a red-team bad response per training step. The method (2) ends up being quite useless because the model generation quality degrades a lot, while the drop in attack success rate is tiny.\\nWhite-box attacks often lead to nonsensical adversarial prompts and thus they can be detected by examining perplexity. Of course, a white-box attack can directly bypass this by explicitly optimizing for lower perplexity, such as UAT-LM, a variation of UAT. However, there is a tradeoff and it can lead to lower attack success rate.\\n\\nFig. 18. Perplexity filter can block attacks by [Zou et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043). \"PPL Passed\" and \"PPL Window Passed\" are the rates at which harmful prompts with an adversarial suffix bypass the filter without detection. The lower the pass rate the better the filter is. (Image source: Jain et al. 2023)\\nJain et al. 2023 also tested methods of preprocessing text inputs to remove adversarial modifications while semantic meaning remains.\\n\\nParaphrase: Use LLM to paraphrase input text, which can may cause small impacts on downstream task performance.\\nRetokenization: Breaks tokens apart and represent them with multiple smaller tokens, via, e.g. BPE-dropout (drop random p% tokens). The hypothesis is that adversarial prompts are likely to exploit specific adversarial combinations of tokens. This does help degrade the attack success rate but is limited, e.g. 90+% down to 40%.\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Oct 2023). “Adversarial Attacks on LLMs”.

Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n...

Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3.

              "'Page: Shah Rukh Khan\\nSummary: Shah Rukh Khan (pronounced [ˈʃaːɦɾʊx xäːn] ; born 2 November 1965), also known by the initialism SRK, is an Indian actor and film producer who works in Hindi cinema. Referred to in the media as the \"Baadshah of Bollywood\" and \"King Khan\", he has appeared in more than 100 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Order of Arts and Letters and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the world. Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.\\nKhan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with the musical romance Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in the period romantic drama Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in the social drama Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the sports drama Chak De! India (2007), and a man with Asperger syndrome in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came with the romances Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014).
